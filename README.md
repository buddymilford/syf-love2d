# Steal Your Face

Simple scroll shooter with some Grateful Dead inspiration.

Recently became obsessed with [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/) and [learned](https://gamefromscratch.com/balatro-made-with-love-love2d-that-is/) it was built using [LOVE2D](https://love2d.org/). Started messing around with it and following [Sheepolution's tutorial on 'How to Love'](https://sheepolution.com/learn/book/contents).
Considering posting on [itch.io](https://itch.io/) eventually.

Looking forward to learning more about game development.
